# oscal-cli
a CLI tool that allows users to manipulate OSCAL formatted data by running commands in the terminal.

To use the tool, run:

python main.py [path/to/oscal_file] [command]

REMINDER:  If you wish to use the poams command, you must use a valid OSCAL POAM file.  For the components and roles command, use an OSCAL SSP file.  The file type is distinguished by naming convention.
